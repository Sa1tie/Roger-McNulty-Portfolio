**Welcome to my professional portfolio.**

I am a Top Secret cleared IT professional transitioning into Business Systems Analysis, bringing a unique blend of technical depth and operational discipline. With a background spanning **U.S. Marine Corps leadership**, **railroad operations**, and **classified defense infrastructure** (BAE Systems & Raytheon), I specialize in translating complex operational needs into actionable technology solutions.

Currently completing my **MBA in Project Management**, I focus on strategic IT planning, cross-functional alignment, and process modernization. This repository demonstrates my ability to document requirements, manage risk, and deliver value in mission-critical environments.
