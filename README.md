**Welcome to my professional portfolio.**

I specialize in structured technical delivery within regulated and classified defense environments. My work sits at the intersection of engineering execution, cybersecurity compliance, and governance-aligned program support.

I translate operational objectives into formal requirements, validated system changes, and disciplined documentation that reduce risk while strengthening mission continuity.

Across roles supporting BAE Systems and Raytheon programs, I have focused on:

• Cross-functional stakeholder alignment
• Risk identification and mitigation
• Modernization of legacy systems
• Lifecycle governance and audit readiness
• Change validation and controlled deployment
• Continuity planning and single-point-of-failure reduction

My background in the U.S. Marine Corps and classified infrastructure environments shapes a disciplined, execution-focused approach to technical initiatives. I operate as a structured delivery partner to engineering, cybersecurity, infrastructure, and leadership teams.

Currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics and PMP certification, I continue to strengthen my ability to support program-level initiatives that require clarity, accountability, and governance alignment.
