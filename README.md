**Welcome to my professional portfolio.**

I specialize in supporting **IT and Security organizations in regulated and classified environments** by clarifying requirements, documenting undocumented systems, and reducing operational risk through disciplined change and service management practices.

My background includes **U.S. Marine Corps leadership** and years of experience supporting mission-critical systems in closed and highly regulated environments, including work with **BAE Systems and Raytheon**. Across these roles, I have focused on strengthening **continuity, audit readiness, and cross-functional alignment** between engineering, cybersecurity, and operations teams.

Currently pursuing an **MBA in Business Analytics**, I focus on translating technical complexity into **clear requirements, risk-aware decisions, and sustainable operational practices** that allow organizations to modernize safely without compromising compliance or mission continuity.

Explore the materials below to see how I support **IT & Security leadership** by enabling controlled change, improving service reliability, and strengthening governance in high-consequence environments.
